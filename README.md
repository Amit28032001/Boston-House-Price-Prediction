**PROBLEMS FACED DURING BUYING A HOUSE:**

1) BUYING A HOUSE IS A STRESSFUL THING.
2) BUYERS ARE GENERALLY NOT AWARE OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE HOUSE PRICES.
3) MANY PROBLEMS ARE FACED DURING BUYING A HOUSE.
4) HENCE REAL ESTATE AGENTS ARE TRUSTED WITH THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS AS WELL AS LAYING DOWN A LEGAL CONTRACT FOR THE TRANSFER. THIS JUST CREATES A MIDDLE MAN AND INCREASES THE COST OF HOUSES.
